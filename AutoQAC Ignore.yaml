# This file contains plugin names that AutoQAC will IGNORE during cleaning operations.
# When adding plugin names, make sure you add it under the correct game list.

# To add plugin names yourself, make sure each plugin starts with a dash followed by a space.
# You can specify the full filename (e.g., "Plugin.esp") or just the name without extension (e.g., "Plugin").
# Entries without extensions will match any file with that name regardless of extension (.esm, .esp, .esl).
# All matching is case-insensitive.
